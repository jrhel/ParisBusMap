# ParisBusMap

This application will show bus lines and their stops on a street map of Paris and its surroundings. Although most map services show Paris Métro and RER networks, including their stations and interchanges allowing users to quickley see how to get from one place to another using the network, it is difficult to get a similar overview of the bus network in the metropolis. This applications aims at filling that need. The applications basic functions should include the ability for users to:

- List all lines entered into the application,
- Project bus stops pertaining to a single, a selection of, or all lines on a street map,
- Show how to get from one place (e.g. a street address or point on map) to another on the map with the network,
- List all lines using a specific bus stop,
- Allow user to create an account and log in/off,
- Allow logged in user to save places (e.g. "Home", "Work", "Gym"; "Marché", etc.) on map for their future reference,
- Allow user to delete account,
- Allow user to edit account information, i.e. username, password, & saved places.

The application could subsequently also:
- Project the lines between their stops on street map
- Include other methods of transport, e.g. Vélib' (i.e. bicyclee sharing) stations, the metro network, etc, and include them in th e applications functionabilities,
- Include timetables and real time journey planning.

Bus lines will be scraped/ read & entered manually from https://www.eutouring.com/paris_bus_route_maps.html & https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RATP_bus_network. Their stops will be scraped/copy-pasted from https://www.bonjour-ratp.fr/en/c/arrets-bus/bus/ and machine fed into the applications database.
